"# DAH_project" 
Everything must be run from the folder. To run code load __main__.py in an IDE and run or 
run from cmd by navigating to folder with python files then typing:
python __main__.py
This will run the code presenting the parameter results in terminal and then plotting the 
various histograms necessary for project.
Note: only figures 37, 38 and 39 are used for the report and analysing the invariant mass spectrum models.
Additionally, all files are needed to run code and you can obtain their purpose by reading the comments in them.

This program needs the following modules to run:
NumPy,
iMinuit,
SciPy,
and Math

as well as all their prerequisites.

Thanks,
Adam.
